I did a project on the distribution of prime numbers back in the spring of 
junior year of high school. To this day, it's the most interesting and
comprehensive project math project I've done, so I wanted to share it.

# The Primes
## Prime Numbers - _The Foundation of Multiplication_

A **prime number** is a number whose factors only consist of 1 and itself.

Prime numbers are the “atoms” of multiplication.

Primes are indivisible and are the building blocks for any whole number other than one.

**The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**

Any whole number (besides 0 and 1) can be broken down to a product of prime numbers.
