# tylerjiang.me
This is my personal website built with Gatsby.js. Everything is designed and built from scratch, except for parts of the blog structure which were extended off of `gatsby-starter-blog`.

I used this project to apply what I learned about React and GraphQL.

## Run / Build Instructions
* To run, clone the project and run `gatsby develop`. 
* To build the project, run `gatsby build`.

## Repurposing the Site
If you want to use this site for yourself, replace the data in `src/data` and replace the blog posts in `src/pages`.
