title: How to Get Into Web Development, From a Fairly Recent Beginner

I'm not an expert in web development by any means, but I've spent quite some time developing on the web and making my own fun little projects. Over the last few years, I've immersed myself in the web development community and upon seeing all that is going on, I decided to put together a little blog post on how I view getting started with web development, especially since in a way, I'm still getting started.

# My Experience With Web
A bit of a breakdown of how I've progressed as a web developer:
* **Sept. 2015 - January 2016**: I took Web Page Design as an elective in high school.
  * Honestly, when I first took this class, I sort of felt like I might have been wasting my time. The class taught the fundamentals: HTML, CSS, and JS, it just didn't seem to understand what modern web development was like. This was mainly because our teacher wasn't a designer, and it didn't seem like the class really understood how to leverage CSS. As a result, it looked like everyone's web page came straight out of the 2000s as if someone just hopped into web.archive.org or something.
  * This class was a great opportunity for me though, because I got a chance to master the fundamentals without rushing into a framework or library I wasn't ready for. Instead, I tried to copy the design of modern web pages purely through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allowed me to hone my skills and master the fundamentals of the web.
  * **Project #1**: Web Portfolio
  * **Project #2**: [The Year In Space](http://tylerjiang.me/the-year-in-space/)
* **Summer 2016**: Feeling like I missed out on "modern web development" in class, I set out to teach myself Django. I was learning Python at the time as well, so I felt like it was a good opportunity to dive into a framework which many described as a great, beginner-friendly framework.
  * I followed some tutorials to build a (very) barebones personal website with a blog (not sure if I ever got to that part).
  * I stopped doing that tutorial because I opted to learn through the tutorial on Django's official page (the one where you have to build an app that allows people to vote on polls). I made it pretty far through that one, but sort of realized that I didn't enjoy it. (My Python also wasn't good enough yet tbh.)
  * I decided to see if I can do something cool with Python and integrate it into the project. I got an RSS feed to our youth group's Google Groups page and rendered the pages on the page using Django. I honestly thought that was one of the coolest things I'd ever done.
    * It also taught me an important lesson on the power of web technologies: you aren't just limited to an HTML page that you type up manually. Any Python library that existed could be leveraged in some way to show up on the web.
  * Also, one of the most important things I got out of this was understanding how modern, server side web frameworks work and also how the Model View Controller pattern allows people to build powerful applications.
* **2016 - 2017**: I largely spent my time on other things during my senior year of high school. I did discover GitHub Pages though, where I deployed some of my old projects from class and built a small, static personal site.
* **May 2017**: In preparation for a hackathon, I really got down to business and learned Django properly. 
  * I went through the entirety of [Hello Web App](https://hellowebbooks.com/learn-django/), which was free at the time (although now I think you have to pay for it).
    * I built and deployed [Wall of Things](https://wallofthings.herokuapp.com).
* **Summer 2017**: Over the summer, I focused a lot of my efforts on developing cool web applications with Django. I decided to learn how to build a web application from scratch by re-designing my local church's website. I launched this as: http://cbcgn.herokuapp.com/
* **Spring 2018**: I spent more time developing web interfaces for our software engineering class, where we focused largely on HTML, CSS, and jQuery, with a Java Spark backend. I learned about AJAX requests.
  * Built Elephluent, learned about CSS flexbox

# How Should Other People Learn Web Development?
Obviously this is a question that I can only answer with an opinion, not a definitive fact. But I think these are important:
* **Get the fundamentals down first.**
  * HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Especially JavaScript. I mean, as people are saying, JavaScript is "eating the world".
  * Try out jQuery too.
* If you're interested in backend web development, try out a backend web framework.
  * If you already know a programming language, it might be good to pick a framework in that language.
  * Python: Django, Flask
  * JavaScript: Node/Express
* For things that don't need a server or a database, just try keeping it static.
  * Gatsby, Jekyll
* Front-end web frameworks
  * React, Vue, or Angular
