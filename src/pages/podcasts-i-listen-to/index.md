Podcasts are a great way for me to kill time and entertain myself, so I thought I'd share some of my personal favorites:

# News / Journalism
## [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/)
This American Life is probably what you think of when you hear the word "podcast." Each episode is a thoroughly developed collection of stories around a central theme, and they often make you seriously think about important issues. The gold standard for audio journalism.

**My Picks**

[#550: Three Miles](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/550/three-miles)

"There’s a program that brings together kids from two schools. One school is public and in the country’s poorest congressional district. The other is private and costs $43,000/year. They are three miles apart. The hope is that kids connect, but some of the public school kids just can’t get over the divide. We hear what happens when you get to see the other side and it looks a lot better. "

[#635: Chip in My Brain](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/635/chip-in-my-brain)

"A boy who can’t dribble gets a coach, a new best friend, and something to believe in."

[#650: Change You Can Maybe Believe In](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/650/change-you-can-maybe-believe-in)

"An innocent man forgives the cop who framed him. An Argentinian talk show that usually treats women as objects suddenly gets really interested in feminism. This week, stories about changes that seem too tidy to be true."

## The Daily

A podcast by The New York Times which focuses on a new story each day. Definitely covers stories in lots of depth, and Michael Barbaro has a great radio voice.


**My Picks**

[Wednesday, May 02, 2018 - The Taxi Driver's Plight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4#)

"A New York City taxi driver, Nicanor Ochisor, took his own life in March. His family says he grew increasingly hopeless as ride-hailing services like Uber took over the industry. Mr. Ochisor’s suicide is one of several in recent months that have called attention to the economic straits of professional drivers."

[Monday, April 30, 2018 - A Family Divided by the Korean War](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4#)

"In a historic summit meeting, North and South Korea vowed to pursue a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War after more than 65 years. That could bring reunions for the thousands of families who have been separated since the war broke out."

# Web Development
## [Syntax.fm]((https://syntax.fm/))
Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski

A great podcast about web development by Scott Tolinski and Wes Bos. They pack a lot of useful information into each podcast while still making it pretty fun and entertaining, which is impressive for a such a technical podcast.

**My Picks**
* [Advice For Beginners](https://syntax.fm/show/058/advice-for-beginners-tech-skills-applying-for-jobs-focus-imposter-syndrome-more) - advice on starting out as a web developer
* [How to Learn New Things Quickly](https://syntax.fm/show/044/how-to-learn-new-things-quickly) - the best way to learn is to do
* [Marketing for Developers](https://syntax.fm/show/052/marketing-for-developers) - understanding your own brand and building a genuine relationship with an audience 

# History
## [Hardcore History](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dan-carlins-hardcore-history/id173001861?mt=2)
Dan Carlin

Dan Carlin is basically a history buff on steroids. He generally releases podcasts every six months or so, but each podcast released is basically an intensely captivating, 4 - 5 hour long story about a moment in history. I think the quality of the podcast is why it's often ranked on the top charts, even with its release schedule.

**My Picks**

[Show 62 - Supernova in the East I](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dan-carlins-hardcore-history/id173001861?mt=2#)

"The Asia-Pacific War of 1937-1945 has deep roots. It also involves a Japanese society that's been called one of the most distinctive on Earth. If there were a Japanese version of Captain America, this would be his origin story."

# NBA

## [Open Floor: SI's NBA Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/open-floor-sis-nba-show/id1050847009?mt=2)
Andrew Sharp and Ben Golliver

My absolute favorite basketball podcast. The show shines with its two hosts, Andrew Sharp and Ben Golliver, who seem to fall at opposite ends of the basketball fan spectrum, yet manage to mesh together perfectly. Sharp, a basketball fan who loves bucket-getters and dramatic storylines, and Golliver, a basketball nerd who describes himself as a "reality-based person" who looks at the NBA through the lens of analytics, provide the podcast with a mix of fun personalities, hot takes, and quality basketball analysis.

**My Picks**

I don't really have a specific favorite podcast that I remember the title to - and that's not what this podcast is about. It's just a consistently good and entertaining way to keep up with the league.

<!-- ## [The Jump](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-jump/id1106886477?mt=2)
Rachel Nichols

The Jump is actually a TV show on ESPN, where Rachel Nichols and the rest of the crew talk about news that happens in the league. Rachel always comes prepared with quality content and has conducted many interviews with big name players like LeBron James, which makes it a great podcast to listen in to. -->

## [The Lowe Post](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-lowe-post/id986595124?mt=2)
Zach Lowe

Zach is a very thoughtful NBA analyst and is always prepared with sound analysis and engaging discussions with his great guests. It's been cool to see him progress from being a hidden gem on the Grantland staff, to being featured on Bill Simmons's basketball shows, to running his own popular podcast.

**My Picks**

[Howard Beck & Rachel Nichols](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-lowe-post/id986595124?mt=2#)

This podcast was especially great because it had three of my favorite NBA journalists, Zach Lowe, Howard Beck, and Rachel Nichols, sitting down, drinking wine, and talking about basketball. Definitely worth listening to.

## [The Bill Simmons Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bill-simmons-podcast/id1043699613?mt=2)

Bill Simmons is definitely a staple in the world of basketball media personalities, and his podcasts often bring on great guests, like Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, or recently, Jayson Tatum, where he's great at having candid conversations that dig into what their lives are like.

**My Picks**

[Stephen Curry on Battling LeBron, NBA Twitter, Klaytheism, and the Quest for Immortality | The Bill Simmons Podcast (Ep. 401)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bill-simmons-podcast/id1043699613?mt=2#)

## [Road Trippin’: Richard vs. Channing](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/road-trippin-richard-vs-channing/id1195897108?mt=2)
Richard Jefferson, Channing Frye, and Allie Clifton

This podcast is hilarious and is one of the few podcasts actually run by current NBA players. Not only that, the podcast started when Richard and Channing were both on the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers team that won the NBA Finals, so the podcast gives a really interesting look at what it's like playing in the NBA at the highest level.

**My Picks**

[Episode 18: Tim Duncan ... Who would have thought?](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/road-trippin-richard-vs-channing/id1195897108?mt=2#)

"Everything that you have ever wondered about the man in his 19 year career is talked about - hobbies, interests, cars, "Pop", tattoos, tongue rings, Richards illustrious San Antonio career & a whole lot more. What you'll soon realize is that Richard & Tim are very similar ... down to earth & sarcastic as HELL!"

[Episode 78: Charles Barkley](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/road-trippin-richard-vs-channing/id1195897108?mt=2#)

"What a special episode we have for YOU - the one & only, “Chuckster”, “Chuck”, Charles Barkley joins us & boy does he waste no time. People always say when it comes to Chuck: what you see is what you get. Couldn’t be more honest & true. From adult beverage advice, to his stardom on the hardwood & now off - we travel all over the map for the next 90 min! His days as a youngster growing up in Alabama, the influence of the Great Moses Malone, the leagues current superstars and this seasons ROY ... fishing, pigs & what life on “Inside the NBA” is really like - be ready to laugh your tail off. Despite no wine for this edition, you learn real fast when it comes to Chuck & Richard - life, it remains the same - & so with that we say, CHEERS!"

<!-- 
## [The Starters](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-starters/id726232322?mt=2)
J.E. Skeets, Tas Melas, Trey Kerby, Leigh Ellis

Originally "The Basketball Jones", the Starters transformed their podcast into a TV show which airs on NBA TV every weekday during the season. They provide a fun take on the basketball talk show with great personalities, fun segments, and interesting analysis. -->
